This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

First we are going to install the iAtlas-modules package to gain access to plotting functions.

```{r}
packages = c("magrittr", "wrapr", "dplyr", "feather", "tidyr")

sapply(packages, function(x) {
  if (!require(x,character.only = TRUE))
    install.packages(x)
    library(x,character.only = TRUE)
})

# and our iatlas package from github
if (!require(iatlas.modules)) {
  devtools::install_github("CRI-iAtlas/iatlas.modules")
  library(iatlas.modules)
}

```

We have a collection of helper functions in the 'notebook_functions.R' file.

The main plotting function we're using here is called 'plotly_bar'.
You can get help with '?plotly_bar'.

Here we'll use source to bring them in.

```{r}
source('functions/notebook_functions.R')
```


# Tissue compartment fractions barplot

In this case we'll assume you have leukocyte, stromal, and immune
tissue fractions for each sample.

We'll need a data.frame with the following columns:

Group         ## (could be anything, but immune subytpe is a good choice.)
fraction_type ## c(leukocyte_fraction, Tumor_fraction, Stromal_fraction)
fraction      ## a numeric value.

Here's a example simulation.

```{r}

df <- data.frame(
  GROUP = sample(x=c('C1','C2','C3','C4','C5','C6'), size=100, replace=T),
  fraction_type = sample(c('leukocyte_fraction', 'Tumor_fraction', 'Stromal_fraction'), size=100, replace=T),
  fraction=rnorm(n=100, mean = 0.5, sd = 0.05)
)

head(df)
```


The notebook_barplot function takes a very specific format, so we'll transform the 
data.frame from above using the 'build_cellcontent_barplot_df2' function.
It essentially gives it a tidy format with generic column names.

Now we're ready to plot. We will use the plot functions from the iatlas.modules 
package.

Here we're plotting the mean fraction per group with error bars.



```{r}

notebook_barplot(
  df,
  sort_by_var_choice = "Group", 
  reorder_func_choice = "None",
  show_error_bars = TRUE,
  ylab = 'Fraction Mean', 
  xlab = 'Fraction Type by Group',
  title = 'Tissue type fractions by group'
)

```


# Cell content plots

Now, suppose we have cell type contents for each sample with groups, meaning each
sample is assigned a group, such as immune subtype. 

In the simulation below, we have 6 goups, and a number of aggregated cell types 
within each group.  Then we have a fraction for each cell type, where the sum
is ~1.0.

```{r}

get_fractions <- function(n){
  f <- runif(n=6)
  f/sum(f)
}

df <- data.frame(
  GROUP = unlist(sapply(1:6, function(i) rep_len(paste0('C', as.character(i)), 6), simplify = F)),
  fraction_type = rep_len(c('Dendritic_cells', 'Eosinophils', 'Lymphocytes', 'Macrophage', 'Mast_cells', 'Neutrophils'), 6),
  fraction=unlist(sapply(1:6, function(i) get_fractions(6), simplify = F))
)

head(df)
```


The barplot function takes a very specific format, so we'll transform the 
data.frame from above using the 'build_cellcontent_barplot_df2' function.
It essentially gives it a tidy format with generic column names.

```{r}

notebook_barplot(
  df,
  sort_by_var_choice = "Group", 
  reorder_func_choice = "None",
  show_error_bars = NA,
  ylab = 'Cell Type Fraction', 
  xlab = 'Fraction by Group',
  title = 'Celltype fractions by group'
)


```



# Plot your results with iAtlas results.

```{r}

# read in the "feature matrix" (fmx)
iatlas_fmx <- feather::read_feather('data/fmx_df.feather')
iatlas_fmx[1:5, 1:5]

```

Let us then create a new data.frame that can be merged with the simulated data above.
Since we're grouping the barplots, we want to make sure the iatlas groups have
different names compared to your groups... even if they represent fundementaly
the same thing (i.e. C2).

```{r}

# first we'll subset to a single cancer type, KICH
kich_fmx <- iatlas_fmx %>% dplyr::filter(Study == 'KICH')

# then we'll annotate the iatlas labels.
kich_fmx$Subtype_Immune_Model_Based <- sapply(kich_fmx$Subtype_Immune_Model_Based, function(x) paste0('iAtlas_',x))

# Next we work towards formatting it in such a way as to bind to the above data.frame
# Above we have cell types:
# 'Dendritic Cells', 'Eosinophils', 'Lymphocytes', 'Macrophages', 'Mast Cells', 'Neutrophils'
kich_fmx2 <- kich_fmx %>% 
  dplyr::select(Subtype_Immune_Model_Based, 
                 Dendritic_cells.Aggregate1,
                 Eosinophils.Aggregate1,
                 Lymphocytes.Aggregate1,
                 Macrophage.Aggregate1,
                 Mast_cells.Aggregate1,
                 Neutrophils.Aggregate1
                 )

# rename the cell types by removing the 'aggregate1'
colnames(kich_fmx2) <- unlist(sapply(colnames(kich_fmx2), function(x) strsplit(x, '.Aggregate1', fixed=T)))
colnames(kich_fmx2)[1] <- "GROUP"

# and finally we'll go from wide to a narrow matrix
kich_fmx2_long <- tidyr::gather(kich_fmx2, fraction_type, fraction, Dendritic_cells:Neutrophils, factor_key=TRUE)

# and we can merge data frames.
new_df <- rbind(df, kich_fmx2_long)

```


With our data.frame combining iAtlas and simulated results, 
we can make a plot showing both the new samples with iAtlas KICH results.

```{r}

notebook_barplot(
  new_df,
  sort_by_var_choice = "Group", 
  reorder_func_choice = "None",
  show_error_bars = FALSE,
  ylab = 'Cell Type Fraction', 
  xlab = 'Fraction by Group',
  title = 'Celltype fractions by group'
)

```


Here, we'll use the reordering function, by selecting one of the cell types
(Neutrophils) and a function (Min, Max, Mean).


```{r}

notebook_barplot(
  new_df,
  sort_by_var_choice = "Neutrophils", 
  reorder_func_choice = "Max",
  show_error_bars = NA,
  ylab = 'Cell Type Fraction', 
  xlab = 'Fraction by Group',
  title = 'Celltype fractions by group sorted by Neutrophils'
)

```
