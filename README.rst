**The Cancer Research Institute (CRI) iAtlas** is an interactive web platform and set of analytic tools for studying interactions between tumors and the immune microenvironment. These tools allow researchers to explore associations between a variety of characterizations of immune response and genomic and clinical phenotypes.

In this repository, you'll find a collection of notebooks enabling the integration of *your* data with what's already in iAtlas. Additionally, you're able to easily visualize the results using our library of plotting functions.

Please see `our landing page`_ for more information. If you'd like to contribute please open an issue or create a pull request.

**Notebooks**

    1. `Cell content barplots`_
        plot estimated cell type contents against samples in our database

    2. `Clinical outcomes`_
        plot survival curves comparing your data to samples in our database
    
    3. `Immune feature trends`_
        investigate using our collection of immune features
