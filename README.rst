CRI-iAtlas notebooks
====================

**The Cancer Research Institute (CRI) iAtlas** is an interactive web platform and set of analytic tools for studying interactions between tumors and the immune microenvironment. These tools allow researchers to explore associations between a variety of characterizations of immune response and genomic and clinical phenotypes.

In this repository, you'll find a collection of notebooks enabling the integration of *your* data with what's already in iAtlas. Additionally, you're able to easily visualize the results using our library of plotting functions.
